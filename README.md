# Rossmann_sales_prediction

Sales forecast for the stores of the european drugstore chain Rossmann.

## 1 Business problem

The stores of the Rossmann drugstore chain need to be restored and the CEO needs to decide how much is going to be dedicated to the restoration of each one. To support this decision, the Analytics team is asked to present a sales forecast for each store during a period of six weeks, alongside with the total income expected in the chain. This forecast also informs the CEO which store is able to account for its own restoration with the income within this period.

## 2 Business Assumptions

* All stores contain a basic sortment, but some of them contain (different kinds of) extra sortments.
* The store's opening on weekends and holidays vary from place to place.
* The stores participate in seasonal promotions. In some of these cases, the promotion is continued for a longer time.
